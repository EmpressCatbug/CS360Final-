# Weight-Tracker Pro

## Project Overview

**Weight-Tracker Pro** is a mobile application designed to help users monitor their weight journey. The app allows users to log daily weights, set weight goals, track progress over time, and stay motivated with personalized notifications. It aims to address the needs of individuals committed to a healthier lifestyle by integrating seamlessly with their daily routine.

## Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of Weight-Tracker Pro is to provide users with a tool to manage their weight effectively. The app was designed to address the following user needs:
- Logging and tracking daily weight entries.
- Setting and monitoring weight goals.
- Receiving reminders and motivational notifications.
- Viewing weight progress in a user-friendly interface.

## Features and UI Design

To support the above user needs, the following screens and features were implemented:
- **Login Screen:** Allows users to log in or create a new account.
- **Weight Entry Screen:** Users can log their daily weight entries.
- **Progress Screen:** Displays weight progress over time in a graphical format.
- **Settings Screen:** Users can set weight goals and notification preferences.

Our UI designs kept users in mind by ensuring simplicity and ease of use. The design was focused on creating a clean and intuitive interface, which was successful as it received positive feedback from the client.

## Development Approach

The development process was approached methodically, focusing on the following techniques:
- **Iterative Development:** Implemented features in small increments and tested them thoroughly.
- **User-Centered Design:** Incorporated user feedback to refine the app's interface and functionality.
- **Best Practices:** Employed industry-standard best practices, including concise classes, consistent style, meaningful naming conventions, and useful in-line comments.

These techniques ensured a robust and maintainable codebase, which can be applied to future projects for similar success.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

The app was rigorously tested using the Android Emulator. The testing process included:
- **Unit Testing:** Ensured individual components worked as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** Verified that different parts of the app functioned together seamlessly.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Confirmed the app met user requirements and provided a satisfactory user experience.

This testing process was crucial for identifying and fixing bugs, ensuring the app's functionality and reliability.

## Challenges and Innovations

Throughout the app design and development process, several challenges were encountered and overcome:
- **Database Management:** Developed a persistent SQLite database to store and manage user data efficiently.
- **SMS Permissions:** Implemented a mechanism to handle SMS permissions gracefully, ensuring the app remained functional even if permissions were denied.

Innovative solutions were applied to address these challenges, demonstrating a deep understanding of mobile app development principles.

## Successes and Highlights

One of the key successes of Weight-Tracker Pro was the implementation of the login functionality, which involved:
- **Secure User Authentication:** Ensured user credentials were securely handled and stored.
- **User-Friendly Account Creation:** Provided an intuitive interface for new users to create accounts easily.

This component particularly showcased our knowledge, skills, and experience in developing secure and user-centric mobile applications.
